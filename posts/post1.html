            <p>Even though I'm fifty years old, I look around at most people I know, including young people, and I'm more of an AI native than they are. And that's what scares me. I should be the one trying to stay up with the young people. Instead, I know how to live in the new world that's emerging around us better than they do. That's not how generations are supposed to work.</p>
